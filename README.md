# GEET INTO ACTION
In this ever changing/evolving world you have to be agile to become number one. Especially, this is true in software development. You have to be fast in developing new features for the software. Otherwise, others will outpace you and you miss the time to market.

That is why you must **geet into action** immediately and automate everything!

We created a workflow that allows everyone to ship a new version of the software just by creating an issue that follows specific template!

Now no one will be able to outpace us, or not?
